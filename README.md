* Prototype: Clone Maker - Creates copies of fully prepared examples.
* Singleton: One and Only - A special class with just one instance.
* Adapter: Universal Plug - Connects things with different interfaces.
* Bridge: Function Connector - Links how an object works to what it does.
* Composite: Tree Builder - Forms tree-like structures of simple and complex parts.
* Decorator: Customizer - Adds features to objects without changing their core.
* Facade: One-Stop-Shop - Represents a whole system with a single, simplified interface.
* Flyweight: Space Saver - Shares small, reusable items efficiently.
* Proxy: Stand-In Actor - Represents another object, controlling access or actions.
* Chain of Responsibility: Request Relay - Passes a request through a chain of objects until handled.
* Command: Task Wrapper - Turns a request into an object, ready for action.
* Iterator: Collection Explorer - Accesses elements in a collection one by one.
* Mediator: Communication Hub - Simplifies interactions between different classes.
* Memento: Time Capsule - Captures and restores an object's state.
* Observer: News Broadcaster - Notifies classes about changes in other objects.
* Visitor: Skillful Guest - Adds new operations to a class without altering it.
